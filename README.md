# timeTeX
a small .tex file, dedicated to create a fancy timetable using tikz


# Description
timeTeX is a .tex file for LuaLaTeX (although the changes for other -TeX machines are minor ones). 
All parts are marked with %%%% \<part-description\> %%%%. Right now you have to change the values 
for the classes like name, location, time, etc. more or less by hand. Hopefully this can be made easier in the future.\
Have fun :-)
